Database Design Final Project - Spring 2022

Members: Michael Buchta, Jason Davonport, Blaine Zelinski

For our project we created a web application for "CSExchange", a website where users can register an account
and buy and sell exchange trade funds on the market. 

The frontend of this application is developed using Flask and python, the DBMS used was PostgreSQL.
